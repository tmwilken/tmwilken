👋 Hi, I’m Tina Marie Wilken (she/her/hers).

💼 I'm a Business Analyst and Strategist based in Tucson, AZ.

👀 I’m interested in leveraging data to drive informed business decisions and optimize strategies. My work typically involves analyzing data trends, generating insightful reports, and identifying opportunities to improve business processes. I focus on uncovering actionable insights that support strategic growth and operational efficiency.

🌱 I’m currently learning Python.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on process improvement projects and market research and competitive analysis projects. I'd love to partner with teams in Operations or HR to analyze pain points and recommend solutions. I'd love to gather and interpret data for marketing, sales, or product development teams.

⚡ Fun facts: 
 1. When I'm not practicing my analyzing skills, I'm collecting more books than I can read in a lifetime.
 2. I finished sewing my wedding dress 7:30am the day of. No one believed I made it.
 3. Bikes are my Achilles heel; just give me rollerblades.
