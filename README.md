👋 Hi, I’m Tina Marie Wilken (she/her/hers).

Many teams struggle with inefficiencies, disconnected data, and systems that don't scale. Whether you're a growing business or a forward-thinking organization, the frustration of unclear insights and operational friction can hold you back.

That’s where I come in.

With a background in finance, operations, and leadership, I have a deep love for data and lifelong learning. I help businesses uncover what's not working and why. I’m especially skilled at turning messy, complex information into clear, actionable strategies that improve decision-making, streamline processes, and create real momentum.

Over the last decade, I’ve worn many hats: accountant, operations lead, consultant, manager, and strategist. Each role sharpened my ability to spot patterns, ask better questions, and build systems that work for the people who use them. Today, I’m expanding that impact through data science ➡️ bringing curiosity, clarity, and strategic thinking to every project.

I'm someone who sees the big picture and sweats the small details. If you're looking for someone who can bridge the gap between people, processes, and performance I'd love to connect.

I believe curiosity is a superpower and I’m here to help organizations harness it.

Let’s connect if you're looking for someone who blends curiosity, strategy, and data to solve real problems. I’m open to new opportunities, collaborations, or conversations that make work smarter and more human.
